# ShoopingList

This Code demonstrates how to implement a Shopping list using [ linked list ]
data structure in C Languange.

Each item in the list has a name and a price.  
The program defines a struct called shopping_list which has  
fields for the name, price, and a pointer to the next item in the list.  
The program provides several functions to manipulate the list:  

1. createItem:  
2. addItem:
3. removeItem:
4. displayList:
5. insertAtBeginning:  
6. popFromBeginning:  
7. insertAtEnd:  
8. DeleteAtEnd:  
9. insertAfter:  

I explained how each function work thoroughly, to find the explanations check  
the source file ShoppingList.c
